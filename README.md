# EctoS3

please do not use this library at the moment.

I am polishing and make it work, first release will be there with the glorious AGPLv3 when the code is stable enough.

also not sure how we gonna do the migration and DB stuff, I need to check some stuff out for seamless integration with any project. so yea, please do not use it rn. but you welcome to help ofc <3.
